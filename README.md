# Intro-to-AI-and-ML
# Assignment 1:
# 1.py:
Implementation of vanilla regression.
# User inputs: 
Number of train samples
Number of test samples

# 2.py:
Implementation of linear regression with a basis(polynomial) function.
# User inputs:
Polynomial order (eg: 3 for degree 3 polynomial)
Number of train samples
Number of test samples

# 3.py:
Implementation of ridge regression with a basis(polynomial) function.
# User inputs:
Same as that for 2.py with an extra input of lagrangian multiplier.

# 4.py:
Probabilistic implementation of linear regression.
# User inputs:
Same as 2.py with an extra input of variance of predictor.

# 5.py:
Probabilistic implementation of ridge regression.
# User inputs:
Same as 2.py with extra inputs of variance of weights(apriori) distribution and variance of predictor.
